# Summary
**Problem level**: Easy

**Time Spent**: 16 Minutes

**Description**

The result is a bit weird, I think the Runtime and Memory execution result from LeetCode cannot be depends on. -- Starting from now I will not attach the result.

**Solution**

1. Setup termition state
2. Create index to traverse and track each input
   1. Return current result if the character of all string in the current index is not same
   2. Add current character to result if all string the current index is same

**Room to improve**

I just hit that submit button once the basic run test was done. I should've come up with more test scenario in the future.
