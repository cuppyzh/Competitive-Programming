# Summary
**Problem level**: Easy

**Time Spent**: 5 Minutes

**Description**

Can't solved with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity （＞人＜；）

**Solution**

1. Using stack to mmic the oder and compare

**Room to improve**

After finished the solution, I tried too look at other solution to achieve O(n) and O(1), I get the concept and how to do it. But the issue is the pointer, it's been a while since I used a pointer (C++) and to use in Go is out of question. I might need to learn again how to use pointer

*Side note* -- the solution modify the linked list, some said that it's violate the rule of modification of the linked list
